The Social Microrinter is an Arudio+WiShield+CBM 231 combination, it reads tweets and other info from a website and prints them to the CBM 231 when a button is pressed. Full write-up:

FOR THE ARDUINO:
This sketch assumes you have a WiShield 1.0 with 1.3 drivers, when the button is pressed it'll talk to microprinter.ianozsvald.com to get the latest printable info.

FOR THE SERVER:

twitterprinter.py gets tweets and prepares an output file called index.html. This is read by the Arduino sketch, it includes the control characters for bold and underline.

microprinter.py is taken from BenOSteen's excellent: https://github.com/benosteen/microprinter

I use the following line to run a cron job every 2 minutes, it runs twitterprinter.py and outputs index.html
crontab:
*/2 * * * * /usr/local/bin/python2.5 /home/ianozsvald/webapps/app_microprinter/twitterprinter.py
runs the script every two mins
